CloudCastle isn't meant to be a preventative, countinous monitoring type tool. It's advantage is easy of access and ease of use to allow quick visibility to where you choose.

The command-line interface is easy to use. All you need to do is to choose cloud provider, which will get you into a menu where you start the scan.\
For example, when choosing  (1) AWS, CloudCastle will automatically list all your accounts and ask which of them you're interested in scanning.
It will also auto-detect where you don't have access and will remove it from the list.

Once the scan is complete, the scan logs will be saved in the /logs folder in JSON format. You can view the HTML version in the /reports folder, which is easily browsable and includes risk levels for each section of your cloud infrastructure.

Once you're ready to browse the report, you can access the /reports folder and open the HTML in your browser.
The most interesting part of CloudCastle is its coding modularity. No matter how many accounts you have and how many services are scanned, the report will dynamically allocate space, colours, tables and other elements to ensure data scalability.
