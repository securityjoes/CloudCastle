# CloudCastle Cloud Security Posture Scanner - Release Notes

# 📦 CloudCastle Release Notes

## CloudCastle v1.5 – May 2025

- Scoring change on all scanners to match risk potential
- Fixed MITRE ATT&CK integration (now dynamic matching + enrichment of local db!)
- Improved S3 public access detection with region-aware logic
- Updated IAM/EC2/RDS/S3 logic to reduce false positives
- HTML report stability improved (gateway handling, error tolerance)
- STS-based multi-account scanning now fully functional

## 🚀 Version 1.4 - (2025-04-25)

### 🔄 Core Enhancements:
- Introduced **multi-account scanning support** for AWS via dynamic SSO session handling.
- Implemented **account-aware logging**, storing results under `logs/aws/<account_id>/logs.json`.
- Added dynamic **session management** with profile auto-detection and error handling fallback.
- Removed the need for hardcoded roles or profiles — SSO sessions are now fully automated.
- Each scan now logs under the correct account context with isolated storage and export mapping.

### 🧠 Reporting and UI:
- Major refactor of `export.py` to dynamically build HTML sections per account.
- Introduced **account buttons** to toggle between account reports in the HTML.
- Added average risk color coding to account selectors for quick posture insights.
- Account names now appear instead of IDs, improving readability for stakeholders.

### 📈 Logging and Structure:
- Restructured logger to support scan-specific data like `scanned_count`, `failed_count`, and `mitre_notes`.
- Each scan result now includes contextual metadata per scan type.
- Added support for rich Jinja error tracing to simplify debugging HTML exports.

### 🧪 Stability and Debugging:
- Improved error messages across session, auth, and export modules.
- Prevented scanning of accounts without valid profiles using pre-checks.
- Enhanced validation of scan data prior to rendering report to avoid malformed exports.

## v1.3.1 - March 30, 2025
### Added
- 🛡️ MITRE ATT&CK integration:

  ✅ Added MITRE mapping logic via `mitre.py` and `mitre_db.json`.
  ✅ Linked techniques rendered in each section of the HTML report.
- 🌐 Cloud provider selector added to CLI (`menu.py`):
  ✅ User selects AWS, Azure, or GCP (placeholders for Azure/GCP).
  ✅ Then selects scan type from relevant cloud menu.

### Changed
- ✅ Export system now shows `mitre_recommendations` cleanly under each scan section.
- ✅ JSON logs now support MITRE insights at scan-type level.

### Fixed
- ✅ Export template now supports rendering of findings alongside each MITRE link.

### Known Issues
